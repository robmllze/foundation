# Foundational Workspace for Flutter

This repository serves as a foundational workspace for effective Flutter application development. It is an amalgamation of several repositories that are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive and scalable architecture for Flutter applications.

## Setup

1. Install Dart/Flutter on your system.
2. Proceed to download and set up Visual Studio Code, ensuring the `code` command is integrated into your system's `PATH`.
3. Navigate to the directory where you keep your projects, for instance, using `cd ~/projects`. Avoid using directories on macOS that synchronize with cloud services, as this can lead to problems with Flutter.
4. Copy the entire block of commands below and paste it into your terminal, then press Enter or Return to clone and set up the workspace:

```bash
cd desktop
curl -o setup.zsh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robmllze/foundation/main/setup.zsh
chmod +x setup.zsh
./setup.sh
rm setup.zsh
```
